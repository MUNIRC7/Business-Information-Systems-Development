BIS Development Project
As part of my coursework for the "BIS Development" module at the University of Westminster, I developed a comprehensive web application prototype for managing product and employee details using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with PHP and MySQL.

Project Overview:
The web application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product and employee records. Key features include:

Product Management: Display, add, update, and delete product details.
Employee Management: Display, add, update, and delete employee details.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation and interaction.
Data Integrity: Ensures accurate and consistent data management.
Efficient Operations: Streamlined processes for managing records.
Object-Oriented Concepts:

Encapsulation: Product and employee data are encapsulated within their respective classes, hiding implementation details.
Inheritance: Products and Employees classes inherit from a base Database class, sharing common functionalities.
Abstraction: Complex database operations are abstracted into methods like find_all and find_by_id, simplifying their usage.
Learning Outcomes:

Demonstrated understanding of the OOP paradigm.
Applied OOP principles to design a medium-scale business system.
Developed a prototype to implement specifications using an appropriate OOP language.
Analyzed different data storage, management, and usage methods in business computing applications.
Engaged in academic and professional discussions reflecting on OOP design knowledge and providing advice for developing business systems.
Deliverables:

Implementation: Developed using OO PHP and MySQL, the prototype includes all necessary classes, database connections, and CRUD functionalities.
Report: Detailed documentation explaining the implementation, code references, and OOP principles applied.
Submission: Uploaded all files to the university server and submitted a single file on Blackboard containing the projectâ€™s web address, report, and code appendix.
This project enhanced my skills in OOP, data management, and web development, culminating in a robust and functional web application prototype.
