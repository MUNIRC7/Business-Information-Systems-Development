Project Description
The web application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product and employee records. It includes:

Product Management: Display, add, update, and delete product details.
Employee Management: Display, add, update, and delete employee details.
Object-Oriented Design: Encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction principles applied in PHP.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation and interaction.
Data Integrity: Ensures accurate and consistent data management.
Efficient Operations: Streamlined processes for managing records.

Object-Oriented Concepts
Encapsulation
Product and employee data are encapsulated within their respective classes, hiding the implementation details and exposing only necessary methods.

Inheritance
The Products and Employees classes inherit from a base Database class, sharing common database-related functionalities.

Abstraction
Complex database operations are abstracted away in methods like find_all and find_by_id, simplifying their usage.

Usage
The web application is designed to:

Manage Products: Add, update, delete, and view product details.
Manage Employees: Add, update, delete, and view employee details.
